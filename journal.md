# Working Journal
The general mix of prompts for each journal entry considered are:
* What I did
* Why I did it
* What I expected
* What were the results

Only had enough time to do some slight countplot visualizations + evaluations for both numerical and categoricals. I realized that during the evaluation it is quite difficult to find there are so many things to consider that will possibly guide my analysis. One thing that I do need to do once I am done with the EDA is to set aside the most interesting visuals/relationships found.

It is interesting to note that after some initial data exploration, that there are features in this original dataset that were randomly represented as a string. I was hoping to visualize the samples and possibly extend it with political leanings of each state but may not be possible. I wonder that this random string assignment was intended to remove any political bias to the analysis. Furthermore, there quite intriguing things that need to be evaluated when seeing the histogram. 

Plans are to continue working on the numerical visual analysis, possibly incorporating some background links regarding H1N1 and information related/public sentiment at the time, and more brainstorming on the possible analysis that can be done.

The tasks finished today was setting up the environment, working github repo, and outlining the jupyter notebook. Furthermore, started some initial eda. 

The dataset that is going to be used is a competition sponsored one that focuses on the public health's response to h1n1 and seasonal vaccine. It is clear that this dataset will serve as a foundation that will possibly be used to cross-reference with the covid-19 vaccine response.
