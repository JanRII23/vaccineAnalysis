# Heart Disease Analysis

This is a personal data science project

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

#### -- The README.md is still a working one

## Project Intro/Objective
Heart disease is one of the leading cause of death globally. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the likelihood of heart disease by combining different Kaggle datasets. The techniques and findings from this project will then be applied to raw datasets related to heart disease.

### Methods Being Used
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter
* Matplotlib
* Pandas, Numpy
* SciKit-Learn
* Dash
* HTML
* JavaScript

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started

1. Setup required installations and environment (refer below)
2. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
3. Refer to the Kaggle Datasets under Links to view datasets being used

4. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
5. etc....
